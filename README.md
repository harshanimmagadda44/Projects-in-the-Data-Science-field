Projects in the field of Data Science 
=====================================

This repository is mainly used to store projects of Data Science field which I have joined and worked for a period of time. You can find all the codes for the corresponding projects in the repository, and download freely. All the projects are developed by *R language*. The following is a list of all the projects. To see my main work of every projects, you just need to click the corresponding title. Welcome to reprint! But please let me know. When I set up to do these work, I was just a beginner of this field, so may be there are many questions remained that I have not noticed. Welcome to point them out and if you have any problems with my work welcome to contact me by e-mail:  **yelangya3826850@126.com**

  * **[Machine Learning](http://yelangya3826850.github.io/datasciencecoursera/)**:  
      
      Using the data from [Human Activity Recognition](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) to predict the manner in         which they did the exercise. The data are collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6        participants.
  * **[Cache Time-consuming Computations](http://rpubs.com/yelangya3826850/CacheTime-consumingComputations)**:
      
      Constructing an R function which is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations. The basic work for future       big data analysis.
  * **[Suggestion for variables influencing motor cars' miles per gallon (MPG)](http://rpubs.com/yelangya3826850/SuggestionforvariablesinfluencingmotorcarsmilespergallonMPG)**:
      
      This project is mainly to work for a certain magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a            collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon       (MPG) (outcome), and mainly answer the following two questions:
      1. **“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”**
      2. **"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"**
  * **[Getting and Cleaning Data]()**
      This is actually not a project but a previous work for the future analysis. You know that raw data nowadays is             becoming more and more dirty and confusing, so it is important to preprocess these data to get a more clean ones. And       this web page is mainly tracing the work of mine processing data.
