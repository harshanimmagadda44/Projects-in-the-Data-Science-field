Projects in the field of Data Science 
=====================================

This repository is mainly used to store projects of Data Science field which I have joined and worked for a period of time. You can find all the codes for the corresponding projects in the repository, and download freely. All the projects are developed by *R language*. The following is a list of all the projects. To see my main work of every projects, you just need to click the corresponding title. Welcome to reprint! But please let me know. When I set up to do these work, I was just a beginner of this field, so may be there are many questions remained that I have not noticed. Welcome to point them out and if you have any problems with my work welcome to contact me by e-mail:  **yelangya3826850@126.com**

  * **[Machine Learning](http://yelangya3826850.github.io/datasciencecoursera/)**:  
      
      Using the data from [Human Activity Recognition](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) to predict the manner in       which they did the exercise. The data are collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of       6 participants.
  * **[Cache Time-consuming Computations](http://rpubs.com/yelangya3826850/CacheTime-consumingComputations)**:
      
      Constructing an R function which is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations. The basic work for           future big data analysis.
  * **[Suggestion for variables influencing motor cars' miles per gallon (MPG)](http://rpubs.com/yelangya3826850/SuggestionforvariablesinfluencingmotorcarsmilespergallonMPG)**:
      
      This project is mainly to work for a certain magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a         collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per          gallon(MPG) (outcome), and mainly answer the following two questions:
      1. **“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”**
      2. **"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"**
  * **[Getting and Cleaning Data](http://yelangya.github.io/Coursera-Data-Science-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data)**

      This is actually not a project but a previous work for the future analysis. You know that raw data nowadays is          becoming more and more dirty and confusing, so it is important to preprocess these data to get a more clean ones.       And this web page is mainly tracing the work of mine processing data.
  * **[Plotting](http://yelangya.github.io/Coursera-Data-Science-Exploratory-Data-Analysis)**
      
      This is actually not a project but a practice of plotting figures in R circumstance which is the basic work for         the future work
  * **[Analysis for Influence of Air Pollutant PM2.5](http://yelangya.github.io/Coursera-Data-Science-Exploratory-Data-Analysis2)**
      
      The overall goal of this project is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008.
